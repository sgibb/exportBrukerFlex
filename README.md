This is a very stupid approach to export
[MALDIquant spectra](https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant) into native Bruker fid
files.

*Please note:* Because the file format is not documented I don't know how to
write `acqus`, `pdata/1/{1r,procs}` files. That's why you could only modify the
intensity values.
